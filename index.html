            <p>My name is Braenaan and I'm 24 living in Granby, Connecticut. My family moved to the US from Ireland in 2000 for my Dad's work in aerospace. I was homeschooled until the age of 15 when I attended Northwestern Community College in Winsted CT, mostly studying one of my passions, history. I've always loved history, mostly influenced by my Father and Grandfather. My main historical interest is the Second World War, currently I am studying the major naval powers of that conflict. I am currently employed by my family's aerospace company in a materials buying / repair manager position. I've been in this role since 2014 supporting the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF for short) and their (K)DC-10 tanker aircraft. The airforce is retiring their tankers at the end of 2021 and I am looking for a career change. I've always loved computers and coding seemed like the logical next step to take.</p>

            <p id="paragraph-2">My favorite past times are computer games, primarily in the FPS or strategy genres. I also enjoy board and role-playing games. Iâ€™ve built five desktops for myself and friends and have found that to be very enjoyable. Recently I've been focusing more on the software side of things getting into game modding with some of my new knowledge. My other favorite pastime is learning more about pretty much everything, whenever I have a spare moment, or even in the background I'll always have a podcast or documentary to listen to. I am fascinated by space and the possibilities that it entails for the future.</p>
